#  TAG: dns_nameservers
#       Use this if you want to specify a list of DNS name servers
#       (IP addresses) to use instead of those given in your
#       /etc/resolv.conf file.
#
#       On Windows platforms, if no value is specified here or in
#       the /etc/resolv.conf file, the list of DNS name servers are
#       taken from the Windows registry, both static and dynamic DHCP
#       configurations are supported.
#
#       Example: dns_nameservers 10.0.0.1 192.172.0.4
#Default:
# Use operating system definitions
dns_nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4			# tambahkan jga ip dns nya
