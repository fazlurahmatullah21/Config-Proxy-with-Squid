#         # match all of the acls [fast or slow]
#         # The first mismatching ACL stops further ACL evaluation.
#         #
#         # ACLs from multiple all-of lines with the same name are ORed.
#         # For example, B = (b1 and b2) or (b3 and b4) can be written as
#         #   acl B all-of b1 b2
#         #   acl B all-of b3 b4
#         #
#         # This group ACL is fast if all evaluated ACLs in the group are fast
#         # and slow otherwise.
#
#       Examples:
#               acl macaddress arp 09:00:2b:23:45:67
#               acl myexample dst_as 1241

#       opposite of the last line in the list.  If the last line was
#       deny, the default is allow.  Conversely, if the last line
#       is allow, the default will be deny.  For these reasons, it is a
#       good idea to have an "deny all" entry at the end of your access
#       lists to avoid potential confusion.
#
#       This clause supports both fast and slow acl types.
#       See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#
#Default:
# Deny, unless rules exist in squid.conf.
#

#
# Recommended minimum Access Permission configuration:
#
# Deny requests to certain unsafe ports
#http_access deny !Safe_ports                     #block safe_ports

# Deny CONNECT to other than secure SSL ports
#http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports              #block ssl_ports 

# Only allow cachemgr access from localhost
#http_access allow localhost manager              #block localhost
#http_access deny manager                         #block deny manager

# We strongly recommend the following be uncommented to protect innocent
# web applications running on the proxy server who think the only
# one who can access services on "localhost" is a local user
#http_access deny to_localhost

#
# INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS
#
include /etc/squid/conf.d/*

# Example rule allowing access from your local networks.
# Adapt localnet in the ACL section to list your (internal) IP networks
# from where browsing should be allowed
#http_access allow localnet
http_access allow localhost
http_access allow mynet                           #masukan nama mynet kita

# And finally deny all other access to this proxy
http_access deny all                              #config deny all

#  TAG: adapted_http_access
#       Allowing or Denying access based on defined access lists
#
#       Essentially identical to http_access, but runs after redirectors
#       and ICAP/eCAP adaptation. Allowing access control based on their
#       output.
#
#       If not set then only http_access is used.
#Default:
# Allow, unless rules exist in squid.conf.
